# THE BUGGER üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: CRYPTIC


### Members
- Team Lead: KASINATH R - COCHIN UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING KUTTANAD


### Project Description
Tired of clean, seamless code? Let THE BUGGER "help" by secretly adding random errors to your script. Once you click the button, there's no going back!
Get ready for runaway buttons you can't click and unsolvable integrals designed to make you pull your hair out.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Simple, working code? Boring. THE BUGGER resonates with the very special few who find joy in pointless challenges. It's designed to take your perfectly fine
code and make it... well, more interesting. If your idea of a good time is wasting hours hunting down bugs you didn't create, you've come to the
right place.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Our solution to the "problem" of working code is THE BUGGER. It lures you in with the promise of optimization, then unleashes an algorithm to systematically 
destroy your script with subtle bugs.Once you're in, the doors are locked. There's no clean code to return to. You can either debug the mess we made or fall 
deeper into a rabbit hole of torment, including buttons that never click and math problems you can't solve. It's an abomination, and we're proud of it.

### Project Documentation
THE BUGGER üêõ
"Why write clean code when you can write chaos?"
Introduction
Tired of clean, working code? Let THE BUGGER "help" you out!
It's a one-click solution to transform your perfect script into a chaotic mess of subtle, hair-pulling bugs.
Then, enjoy our bonus mini-games of frustration, including a runaway button and an impossible integral!

The "Problem" We Solve
Let's be honest, clean and structured code is boring. This app is for anyone who thinks the real fun is in the chaos‚Äîfor those who want to waste their time fixing bugs that THE BUGGER has lovingly added to their perfectly good code.

The Solution
The solution is simple: THE BUGGER.

Built for developers with far too much time on their hands, it disguises itself as a sleek, professional website that promises to make your code "better." It's a lie. The moment you click the button, a devious algorithm injects your script with a fresh batch of infuriating bugs.

There's no going back. Every escape route is a trap, from unsolvable integrals to buttons that actively run away from your cursor. Your only choices are to debug the chaos or accept your fate. Good luck escaping this abomination.

Features
One-Click Bug Injection: Turns your pristine code into a minefield of errors with a single click.

Dynamic Theme Change: Shifts from a professional, "glassmorphism" UI to a glitched-out, red-and-black hacker theme.

The Runaway Button: A button that you can never, ever click. It comes with taunts and a custom sound effect on every dodge.

The Impossible Integral: A final challenge to test your sanity, complete with a series of escalating taunts for every wrong answer.

Escape Hatch: A "Go Back" button for those who admit defeat and wish to return to the buggy code.

Tech Stack
Languages: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6)

Libraries:

Prism.js: For beautiful syntax highlighting in the code editor.

Google Fonts: For importing the 'Inter', 'Fira Code', and 'DotGothic16' fonts.

Frameworks/Tools: None! This is a pure, vanilla JS project.

How to Use
Clone or download the repository.

Open the index.html file in any modern web browser.

Paste your code (or use the sample) and click the "Make My Code Better! ‚ú®" button.

Descend into madness.

Customization
To add your own sound effect for the runaway button:

Place your audio file (e.g., sound.mp3) in the same directory as index.html.

Find the <audio> tag in the index.html file (around line 317).

Update the src attribute with the name of your file:
